# trialLoops_extreme

In this problem set, you will modify your trialloops solution from the last problem set to include several new features:

1. If your trials don't already include collecting a response, add this in.
2. Track trial-by-trial accuracy and reaction times. Note, if accuracy doesn't make sense for your trials (e.g., ratings or preference judgments or something similar), keep track of a simple calculation on the responses you are collecting (e.g., if a scale value is greater or less than the midpoint of the scale).
3. Provide trial-by-trial feedback that is contingent on the response. For example, display "correct!" if the response is correct, or if you're using a rating scale, display "big value" if the scale measure is greater than the scale midpoint. Some sort of feedback should be provided on every trial.
4. Print out a summary of the trial-by-trial accuracy and reaction times for your trial loop.

This problem set will be an individual assignment but definitely feel free to work together!

We've extended the CoderIngredients.py file from the last problem set to incorporate the functionality we discussed in lecture 6. You'll find this extended file here in this repository.
